# Personal Network Assistant
An app that tracks communications, activities, events, calls, etc to members of your personal network.

* An app that tracks communications, activities, events, calls, etc to members of your personal network. 
* Connects to social networks to gather any useful info about contacts, tracks mutual events with contacts, etc
* Keep track of important info from people in your network -- Facebook is great for reminding you of people’s birthdays, but not everyone is on facebook, and birthdays aren’t the only things that are important to remember.  Track special dates, family names, special events, important info, or pretty much anything notable about your contacts. Then you can see what important dates (birthdays, anniversaries, or events) are coming up in your network. 
* Diary function: Record events/activities with your contacts.  Eg. weekend trips with friends to remember funny quotes, special songs, memorable moments, places you went, etc.
** We all like to think we’ll never forget those special moments with our friends, but the sad reality is that our brains can’t remember everything.  Sometimes getting reminded of a song, or a joke sparks great memories. Why not have a way to spark those memories more easily?!
* Keep in touch function:  informs you of people that you haven’t reached out to in a while. When was the last time you talked to your aunt or high school friend that you still keep in touch with sometimes? 
* Keep track of new contacts -- meet someone new at an event, or through a friend:  After meeting someone new, record who introduced you and/or where you met them. Then when you’re trying to remember what that person’s name is, or you remember where you met them, but forgot who introduced you or what you talked about, you can simply search the parts you do remember to connect the dots and remind you of the full interaction.
